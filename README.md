Poker Library Project in C#
===========================

This library implements a partial version of Poker card game.

(Note: Make sure you are cloning the testing branch as that's the one with the latest commits).

There are two projects in this **Visual Studio** (VS) solution repository, **Poker** and **PokerTests**. PokerTests would be a good entry point to this project. It contains Unit tests, Poker Game Simulation and a extensibility demo. Cloning and running this project is pretty straight forward, just clone the repo and import the project into VS.

The **Game Simulation** is a command-line based game for demonstrating the use of the Poker library. The PokerTest project is set as a Console project, so you just need to run the project in VS in order to execute the simulation.

Further the **extensibility** demo shows how the library can be extended for adding new features to it. The loosely coupled service classes allows different versions of the interface to be implemented according the need of the library
